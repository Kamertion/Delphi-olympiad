There is a matrix with 0 and 1 and it's heights and width

Each 1 means that there is a building. Bulding can consist of any amount of 1

Building are not touching each oter or matrix walls.

Calculate amount of square buildings in matrix

Is there any way to improve my code? Because I think 4 nested loops are bad idea.
